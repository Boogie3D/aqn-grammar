2 & 3. We implemented the following phenomena in both our choices customizaiton file and testsuite:

1.    
    A. Aspect: Perfect
        Northern Alta by default doesn't show aspect. However, there are two inflections
        that show perfect and progressive aspect, respectively. These inflections are common,
        but the descriptive grammar's examples suggest that most sentences' verbs simply don't 
        show aspect. The perfect aspect inflection is an infix, -in-, that is typically just
        "inside" the verb stem. However, -in- actually precedes some other infixes. In particular
        one active voice infix, -um-, when applied, must appear to the right, e.g. "-in-um-."

            'where did (you) run?'

        We modeled this aspect inflection by implementing a verb morphotactics position class. 
        "Infix-aspect" is an obligatory infix position class with two lexical rules: one changes
        nothing and simply passes the verb on to the next position class. The other lexical rule
        adds either -in- or C-in- to the input, and specifies perfective aspect in its feature
        structure.

    B. Progressive/Imperfect

        Progressive aspect is shown by an infixed consontant reduplication, -C-. This inflection
        is less perpiscuously marked since other affixes may cause consonant reduplication 
        towards the beginning of the verb. So while perfect aspect might show "-in-um-" the 
        analogous voiced verb with progressive aspect is "C-um--C-." Our descriptive grammar 
        claims that the opening consonant reduplication is merely phonolgoical, and not morphotactic.

            'while eating, father arrives'

        We modeled this aspect by adding a morphotactic position class "progressive_infix." This
        position class is obligatory, takes the non_derived_V_words lexical type as input. We added
        this lexical type this week to contain all the verbs we could identify that can be inflected
        for aspect. This infix is actually the very first in our chain of verb affixes, since
        progressive affixes seem to occur in the innermost position. Unfortunately, since the perfective
        infix appears a bit further out, we cannot simply have a single aspect position class to handle
        both progressive and perfective affixes. The exact construction of the progressive consonant
        reduplication also depends on the particular voicing the verb will receive, thus there are more
        lexical rules and options in this position class than there are in the perfective "infix-aspect."
        If the verb receives the actor-voice "meng-" prefix, then the progressive infix is actually -CV-,
        whereas for conveyance voice progressive, the infix is "-eC-." To accomodate this variability we
        used the following lexical rules. Each of these lexical rules change the verb's aspect to imperfect.

                  verb-pc8_lrt5_lri1_orth=-'eC-

        These implementations of aspect seem to work. The morphotactics at least seems to accept verbs with
        valid affix concatenations. To that end, we testsed some examples that are not in our current test
        suite:

         -in--um-de'él in ána'
         -in--um-de'el in ana'
         -PRF--AV-grew.up ABS child
         the child grew up

        But, as per lab instructions and as shown above, some of our testsuite examples actually already
        manfisted this phenomenon.

2. Voice Affixes:

        Northern Alta has an extensive "voice" system whereby verb stems gain change argument structure
        and their arguments change semantic role. There are several, but we attempted to implement the
        main six: actor voice, patient voice, locative voice, stative, conveyance voice, and potentive.
        Each of these requires distinct affixes and the voices themselves are generally incompatible, 
        with the exception of potentive, which may be combined with other voices.
        
    A. Actor voice -um- and meng-
        There are two different actor voice affixes, -um- and meng-. They both inflect the verb-stem
        for actor voice, which always takes an absolutive subject and may take an optional oblique
        undergoer object. The actor voice -um- infix may be used for meterological events (though we 
        have not yet implemented these), change of state, or in predicates where the subject takes an
        "actor" role. The actor-voice "men-" prefix expresses a "durative action that lacks an inherent
        terminal point" (García Laguía, 222). This actor voice prefix likewise takes an absolutive subject
        argument and optionally an oblique or locative undergoer object. Following the descriptive grammar,
        we grouped this prefix together with the actor-voice prefix "meng-" which also express actions, take
        an absolutive subject, and an optional oblique object.

        To implement this actor voice affix, we wrote two separate position classes. Since -um- is an
        infix close to the verb stem, it is the second link of our verb morphotactic chain, after
        the progressive inflection. Unfortunately, we could not get the transitive version of -um- to
        work. We tried implementing it as part of the same position class as the intransitive lexical
        rule below, and as an independent position class. Both of these methods failed, and it's unclear
        to us why. We did manage to implement the intransitive version, as follows:

              verb-pc4_name=infix_um
              verb-pc4_obligatory=on
              verb-pc4_order=prefix

                  verb-pc4_lrt3_lri1_inflecting=no

        To implement the meng- actor voice prefix, we created corresponding valence-changing lexical 
        rules in our "prefix_voice" position class. This class contains all prefixes that alter verb
        voice, including conveyance voice, potentive voice, stative voice, and causative. We restricted
        the meng- lexical rules to make sure they don't take verbs already inflected with the -um- affix
        but allow them to modify stems that have progressive or perfective infixes. The intransitive
        meng- lexical rule changes the argument structure to intransitive, and constrains the subject
        to be absolutive. The transitive meng-lexical rule changes the argument structure to intransitive
        (abs-obl), adds an object, constrains the subject to be absolutive, and constrains the 
        added-object to be oblique case.
