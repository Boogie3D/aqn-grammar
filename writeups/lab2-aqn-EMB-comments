1. Yes, you may.

EMB> Thank you!

2. Fortunately, I didn't have to take any steps to get from automatically constructed choice file to one that would customize and compile. The  automatically generated choice file was ready to work with no editing!

EMB> I'm glad it worked out of the box!
EMB> For group projects, I would expect 1pl (`we') in the description --- you're reporting on what both project members did.

EMB> I think you mean "results" and not "readings" -- "readings" would be the total number of analyses across all items and could in principle be higher than 2240. Or if you mean "readings" (i.e. analyses) then readings/parses isn't an intersting metric. What is interesting is coverage (number of items for which the grammar provides a parse/total number of items) and average ambiguity (number of readings/total number of items that got any reading at all). Average ambiguity is always >= 1.

|             |                      | entries          |                        |
+-------------+----------------------+------------------+------------------------+

EMB> If there is zero coverage (here, for the auto generated grammar) over something, there can be no ambiguity, and thus no sources of ambiguity.

    1-4. Please not that my revised grammar claims 5 spurious readings. 
         These readings are false because they do not account for each 
         word in the item string. These terms are not in the lexicon because
         are pronouns that go beyond the scope of my current modifications. The
         Northern Alta's case and pronouns system is quite complex, and adding
         those pronouns would be too large a time commitement for now, though is
         an interesting future modification,

EMB> I'm glad you are setting limits and not trying to do the whole thing!
EMB> I'm not sure what you mean by "do not account for each word in the item string". If the grammar doesn't have lexical coverage for an item, then it can't possibly give any readings -- spurious or otherwise. Do you maybe mean that while there is lexical coverage, some of the words get no correct analysis?

    5. I didn't completely understand this instruction, but took it to mean 
       "for any 10 arbitrary readings, which, if any, of them look reasonable
        in the semantics?" Accordingly, I browsed the test corpus readings 
        generated by the automatic grammar. I looked at over 15 and the only
        item that looked like it might have reasonable semantics was item 720,
        though its syntax seems off since it cannot stand alone as an S.
        
        After applying the modified grammar to the test corpus, there's a chance
        simple items like 1550 and 1680 might have close semantics, though I'm not 
        sure what kind of item they are since the word category of Northern Alta is
        fairly comlpex. It seems possible that one of the readings of 5480 could be
        semantically reasonable. Likewise for 20,950. Overall I'm still getting a 
        grip on Northern Alta, it's difficult for me to parse for now as it's quite
        distinct from any other language I've seen.

EMB> Again, I wonder about the "I" in this write up. Did you not collaborate as partners on this part?

EMB> When you are discussing specific items, please include the IGT in your write up. I went an dug out the IGT for 720 and I see this:

720@@@@1@@eC-úlam-en@@@@1@1@PRG-viand-PV  // add to a dish@@

EMB> Which I take to mean that the linguist glossed it as a single lexical item. I see in the parse that the grammar applied the rules for subject and complemen dropping, so this is being parsed as "someone added something to a dish" or "someone vianded something". I have no idea what "viand" means though.

1550@@@@1@@gaté'@@@@1@1@coconutmilk  // coconut milk@@

EMB> I doubt this is a good parse---unless there is really strong evidence that that's a verb in the language, and not a noun.

1680@@@@1@@tápos@@@@1@1@then  // then@@

EMB> Same story here. I don't think this is a sentence.

20950@@@@1@@a ginto@@@@1@2@LK gold  // of gold 103.409@@

EMB> Same here. For future labs, please explore the semantics for items that are glossed as sentences. For example, this one looks more promising:

1020@@@@1@@as'an ti patabá=na=i@@@@1@3@add OBL fertilizer=3s.GEN=SPEC  // SPEC@@

EMB> Though the system seems to have picked up `ti' as a determiner meaning `obl', which doesn't make sense. What do your reference materials have to say about `ti'?

EMB> Looking at your parse results, I see many cases where the LKB as I'm running it isn't finding anything, but your profile has a result stored. Can you post to Canvas with screen caps of the analysis you get for 1080, for example? It seems like something in your settings is allowing the LKB to just skip words that start with = (maybe).

4. I added basic case marking for actor-voice intransitive predicates
   to my test suite. Such predicates should take Absolutive (or focus)
   case arguments. To test for this, I added sentences like "me'una
   siya" which may take this construction in Northern Alta. Siya is a
   3rd person singular absolutive inpersonal pronoun, and I tested
   this same construciton against other pronouns, such as "mo," which
   is a second person inpersonal genitive pronoun. I tested this
   phenomena across other predicates as well, for Northern Alta marks
   actor-voice predicates in multiple ways. The prefix "men" or the
   infix "um" may contribute this case cosntraint. I also added tense
   to my testsuite. Northern Alta expresses tense largely with
   adverbs. So I added many of the pertitent adverbs to distinguish
   between present, past, and future tense events. These include
   "ududma" (tomorrow), "dya'yay" (now, presently today), and "sep"
   (still).

EMB> The instructions ask you to include examples from your testsuite in this part of the write up. By that, I don't mean examples in the running text of your write up, but separate IGT, like in linguistics papers. Also, I don't see your testsuite, which means I can't give you detailed feedback on it. From the lab instructions: "Be sure your write up (and the text-file version of your test suite) is included in your grammar directory."

EMB> If tense is marked as adverbs, then it is not tense in the sense described here:
http://courses.washington.edu/ling567/testsuites.html#tma

EMB> As for case---it sounds like things are pretty complicated in Northern Alta! Do all of the verbs bear some marking for voice? (Is this an Austronesian language?)

   conveyance).  The focus marked argument typically takes absoltuive
   voice. So in actor-voiced predicates the actor will be absolutive

EMB> I think you mean absolutive case?

section=case
case-marking=focus
focus-focus-case-name=abs
focus-a-case-name=gen
focus-o-case-name=obl
  case2_name=loc

EMB> This looks plausible ... but will only do what you want once you create lexical rule for the voice morphemes on verbs.

However, Northern
   Alta also has predicates that are not voice-marked. In some such
   cases, e.g. existentials and some possessives, the S value is
   typically absolutive case. In non-existential non-voiced predicates
   the S argument is also typically marked with absolutive case.

EMB> If we get to existentials, I think they would just have their
own case frame and then not allow the voice morphology to attach.
For non-existential non-voiced predicates, if the predicates could
be voice marked but aren't, then what you'd want is a zero affix that
adds the S=abs case frame.

EMB> S is intransitive subject. Are all transitives always voice marked?

EMB> You give a good description of the case system, but you describe (in #5) what you did to implement it. What choices did you specify?

    Tense: Northern Alta does not inflect verbs to show tense, but
    instead relies on adverbial phrases. These adverbs should follow
    the main predicate, and are not subject to agreement. Aspect:
    Northern Alta uses verb afixes to inflect for perfective and
    progressive aspect.Verbs are inflected for voice, and depending on
    their voice inflection will take slightly different inflections to
    show aspect. Sometimes an afix is added, other times consonant
    reduplication is involved.  Since modifying the afixes and infixes
    would be too difficult at this stage, I started by simply
    introducing some tense adverbs, since the automatically generated
    grammar had none.

EMB> Where and how did you add these adverbs?

6. Though I have started to implement a case system, Northern Alta's
   case markings are very complicated. There are many pronoun
   categories and each also implements case variation. Moreover,
   Northern Alta often shows case via particles that have no semantic
   or syntactical contribution beyond marking case to saturate the
   predicate's case requirements. I couldn't find an elegant solution
   for this on the Matrix, so I resorted to classifying these
   particles determiners so they would resolve nicely with the
   arguments that follow them. However, this solution is at best
   temporary, since Northern Alta allows for such particles to occur
   mutliple times in a phrase, even in adjacent positions it seems. So

EMB> Please ask more questions on Canvas through the week! For "particles"
we do have a solution --- we treat those as case marking adpositions.
(Maybe that's what `ti' is, actually?)

   the particle can saturate the predicate's requirement for an
   absolutive argument while the noun phrase itself might use a
   further locative or genitive determiner. Beyond this issue, I would

EMB> I can't make sense of this without examples in IGT. 

   like to implement aspect, though Northern Alta's use of
   phonetically variable infixes and affixes will make this
   challenging.

EMB> Please provide IGT, including from the linguist-provided corpus.
How do these infixes get represented on the morpheme segmented line.
That is what we are trying to target.

7. The automatically created choices file misidntifies many parts of
   speech. It doesn't handle case at all, and so many of the case
   particles which I have treated as determiners the automatic grammar
   simply lists as nouns. The result is a preponderance of readings
   with coordinated noun phrases. I plan to remove change the
   coordination rule to prevent this, but a better model of case,
   determiners, and pronouns would help as well.

EMB> Yes, it will! But they likely aren't determiners --- case marking
adpositions is probably a better bet. Among other things, that will
keep you from having things like _abs_q_rel (which don't make sense)
in the semantics.
