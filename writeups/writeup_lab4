3. We made the following choices in our customization system:

A. Adnominal possession: We added two adnominal possession phenomena to our customization system. The first is a possessive strategy that accounts for possessive noun phrases. In Northern Alta, these phrases take the form possessum initial, possessive particle in the middle, and possessor argument must not be a pronoun and appears in last position. None of the arguments are inflected, and the determiner is a separate word "nen." The possessor is more like a possessum modifier than a specifier, as it follows the possessum, which determiners may still precede. In fact it is quite common for the possessum to be preceded by a case, proximity, or number marking determiner. Consequently, our choices file implements the following options:

section=adnom-poss
  poss-strat1_order=head-initial
  poss-strat1_mod-spec=mod
  poss-strat1_mark-loc=possessor
  poss-strat1_pronoun-allow=no
  poss-strat1_possessor-type=non-affix
  poss-strat1_possessor-mark-order=head-initial
  poss-strat1_possessor-agr=non-agree
  poss-strat1_possessor-orth=nen
  poss-strat1_possessum-type=non-affix
  poss-strat1_possessum-mark-order=head-final
  poss-strat1_possessum-agr=non-agree
  poss-strat1_possessum-orth=nen

These choices accurately model the semantics in simple possessive sentences as follows:

palitan na in beli nen aparato
palit-an=na       [in  beli  [nen aparato]]
palit-an=na       [ʔin beli  [nen aparato]]
change-LV=3s.GEN  ABS  frame POSS device
'he changes the frame of the device'

We also added possessive pronouns to our customizaiton system. These are all separate words or clitics that appear to the right of the possessum. These possessive pronouns show no agreement with the possessum and function as modifiers, since the possessum may itself follow an independent determiner.

poss-pron1_type=non-affix
  poss-pron1_agr=non-agree
  poss-pron1_mod-spec=mod
  poss-pron1_order=head-initial
    poss-pron1_instance8_orth==miyu
    poss-pron1_instance8_feat2_name=pernum
    poss-pron1_instance8_feat2_value=2pl

These selections successfully model simple possessive pronouns as found in the following example:

dumateng tiyama miyu
d<um>ateng tiyama =miyu
d<um>atәŋ  tijama =miju
<AV>arrive ABS.father =2p.Gen
'your father arrives'

B. Clausal Modifiers: We implemented one clausal modifier strategy. Northern Alta allows modifier clauses before or after the main clause, appear at the beginning of the subordinate clause, do not require nominalization, attach at the S level, and do not mark the main clause.

section=clausalmods
  cms1_position=either
  cms1_modifier-attach=s
  cms1_subordinator=free
  cms1_subposition=before
  cms1_subordinator-type=head
    cms1_freemorph5_orth=habang
    cms1_freemorph5_pred=_while_subord_rel

There are 14 different free subordinator forms. These selections above accurately model subordinating clauses appearing both before and after the main clause, as shown below:

dumateng tiyama habang meng-an
d<um>ateng tiyama      habang meng-an
d<um>atәŋ  tijama      habaŋ  meŋ-an
<AV>arrive ABS.father  while  AV-eat.ABS
'father arrives while eating'

habang meng-an, dumateng tiyama 
habang meng-an, d<um>ateng tiyama      
habaŋ  meŋ-an,  d<um>atәŋ  tijama      
while  AV-eat.ABS, <AV>arrive ABS.father  
'while eating, father arrives'
