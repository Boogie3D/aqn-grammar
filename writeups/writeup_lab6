1. semi.vpm changes

    A. The most significant section of the semi.vpm file we changed is the PNG.PN section. We tried
    implementing some of our own, and had moderate success. But the basic variable rules provided 
    on the DELPHIN Github page seemed to work better. So we used those values as a starting point 
    and modified them slightly. Northern Alta has one person value that English lacks, 
    first-person-exclusive. We initially thought to map this value to third-person, but weren't certain.
    But we couldn't seem to get the exclusive code to read in semi-vpm, so we omitted it. Editing this 
    file significantly reduced our realizations. This improvement was most evident when translating from 
    Northern Alta to English. For example, we now achieve only three realizations for translation sentence 
    3, all differing only in tense, for which Northern Alta doesn't inflect. The resulting PNG.PN section 
    is as follows:

            PNG.PERNUM : PER NUM
              1sg  <> first sg
              1pl  <> first pl
              2sg  <> second sg
              2pl  <> second pl
              3sg  <> third sg
              3pl  <> third pl
              1st  <> first !
              1st  << first *
              2nd  <> second !
              2nd  << second *
              3rd  <> third !
              3rd  << third *
              sg   <> ! sg
              sg   << * sg
              pl   <> ! pl
              pl   << * pl
              *    >> ! !
              !    << * *

    B. Since Northern Alta doesn't have tense as a grammatical category, our E.TENSE section is quite
    small. To show past or future Northern Alta uses temporal adverbs that specify when an event occurs.
    Accordingly, we follow the descriptive grammar and treat instances without a temporal adverb as 
    present tense by default. The resulting in the following semi.vpm section:

        E.TENSE : TENSE
          present <> present
          present << [e]

    C. Northern Alta inflects verbs for perfective and imperfective aspect. Accordingly we edited 
    the E.ASPECT section of semi.vpm file to map these specific values, and all others to an empty
    parent aspect type simply titled "aspect."

        E.ASPECT : ASPECT
          imperfective << progressive
          imperfective <> imperfective
          perfective <> perfective
          aspect << [e]

2. Improved Phenomena

    A. Morphology: Since a huge portion of the realizations our grammar produced showed different
    verb and noun affixes, we heavily edited and constrained these options. We divided the verb
    lexicon according to which prefixes and suffixes they accept in our current testsuite and
    translation sentences. We then restricted the morphotactics to require the corresponding verb
    type. These cosntraints led to a vast reduction in realizations, but a concomittant reduction in
    flexibility or "coverage." Now verbs the descriptive grammar shows as taking two or three affixes,
    some transitive others intransitive, take one and only one affix. Accordingly each of our verb
    morphology position classes has a new require rule in the choices.tdl file:

    Additionally, many of our verb affixes have allophonetic variation we encoded with multiple
    orthographies. To prevent the translation from providing a different realization for each form 
    of the same affix, we included each form in a single lexical rule. Thus our irules.tdl file 
    implemented the following changes:

        infix_um_intrans-prefix1 :=
        %prefix (* -um-) (* C-um-)
        infix_um_intrans-lex-rule.

        perfect_aspect-prefix1 :=
        %prefix (* -in-) (* C-in-)
        perfect_aspect-lex-rule.

        prefix_meng_intrans-prefix1 :=
        %prefix (* men-) (* mengi-) (* meng-)
        prefix_meng_intrans-lex-rule.

        prefix_meng_trans-prefix1 :=
        %prefix (* men-) (* mengi-) (* meng-)
        prefix_meng_trans-lex-rule.

        prefix_stative-prefix :=
        %prefix (* me-) (* ma-)
        prefix_stative-lex-rule.

    Since we implemented morphotactics for nouns, but omitted most of the affixes' semantic and
    grammatical contributions, we were able to comment those lexical rules out in irules.tdl. So
    though our grammar includes lexical rules for appending noun affixes such as peng-, which is
    a locative common noun inflection, they currently will not apply in translation.

        ;;; content_word_prefixes-lex-rule.

        ;;; content_word_prefixes-lex-rule.

        ;;; content_word_prefixes-prefix5 :=
        ;;; %prefix (* pet-)
        ;;; content_word_prefixes-lex-rule.

        ;;; alternation-suffix1 :=
        ;;; %suffix (* -an) (* -'an)
        ;;; alternation-lex-rule.

        ;;; alternation-suffix3 :=
        ;;; %suffix (* -'en) (* -en)
        ;;; alternation-lex-rule.

        ;;; adverb_D-lex-rule.

        ;;; little_adj-suffix1 :=
        ;;; %suffix (* -ba'ik) (* ba'ik)
        ;;; little_adj-lex-rule.

    B. Initially the unvoiced_common-noun-lex definition did not have any value specified for 
    CAT.HEAD.CASE-MARKED, and thus common nouns were able to combine with verbs via the 
    HEAD-COMPLEMENT or HEAD-SUBJECT rule without the prequisite case-marking adposition. To 
    rectify this, we included a new line in the lexical type definition that specifies common 
    nouns as - for case marking, which implements the requirement that they take a case-marking 
    adposition before unifying withe HEAD-COMPLEMENT or HEAD-SUBJECT rule. 

      unvoiced_common-noun-lex := noun-lex & initial_suffix-rule-dtr & ultimate_suffix-rule-dtr &
        [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX.PNG.PERNUM 3rd,
		          CAT.HEAD.CASE-MARKED - ],
          INFLECTED [ PREFIXES-FLAG -,
                      INITIAL_SUFFIX-FLAG -,
                      ULTIMATE_SUFFIX-FLAG - ] ].

    Once this revision was made, our grammar successfully parses testsuite item #29, and, as desired,
    rejects item #30, where the case-marking adposition is absent.

    We also had difficulty getting our grammar to accept PP's for the complement argument in the
    HEAD-COMPLEMENT rule. We changed all our case-marking determiners into case-marking adpositions.
    After this transition, we had difficulty getting PP's to combine with VP's via the HEAD-COMPLEMENT
    rule. We learned that we can specify if a verb takes an NP or VP complement in the valence-changing
    operation section of the morphology sub-page. Additionaly, we learned how to edit northern_alta.tdl
    directly to allow the HEAD-COMPLEMENT rule to take different phrase types for the complement value.

    Once this revision was made, our grammar successfully parses testsuite item #23, where the 
    complement is a PP formed by a case-marking adposition and noun.

    Once we had implemented these changes, our adnominal possession possessive strategy worked as planned!
    Northern Alta's possessive particle "nen" follows the possessum and precedes the possessor. Norhtern 
    Alta's also allows for possessive pronouns, which worked before the modificaitons above. With the 
    modifications above and our pre-existing implementation of possessive pronouns and the possessive strategy 
    for "nen" our grammar succeessfully translated to and from the sample sentences provided in eng.txt and 
    sje.txt with few supperfluous realizations.
