Please note in our tarball, the files in tsdb/home that are labeled "old grammar" were run with the automatically generated grammar, 
and the unlabeled files were run with the modified grammar.

1. Yes, you may.
2. Fortunately, I didn't have to take any steps to get from automatically constructed choice file to one that would customize and compile. The  automatically generated choice file was ready to work with no editing!

    1-4. Please not that my revised grammar claims 5 spurious readings. 
         These readings are false because they do not account for each 
         word in the item string. These terms are not in the lexicon because
         are pronouns that go beyond the scope of my current modifications. The
         Northern Alta's case and pronouns system is quite complex, and adding
         those pronouns would be too large a time commitement for now, though is
         an interesting future modification,
    5. I didn't completely understand this instruction, but took it to mean 
       "for any 10 arbitrary readings, which, if any, of them look reasonable
        in the semantics?" Accordingly, I browsed the test corpus readings 
        generated by the automatic grammar. I looked at over 15 and the only
        item that looked like it might have reasonable semantics was item 720,
        though its syntax seems off since it cannot stand alone as an S.
        
        After applying the modified grammar to the test corpus, there's a chance
        simple items like 1550 and 1680 might have close semantics, though I'm not 
        sure what kind of item they are since the word category of Northern Alta is
        fairly comlpex. It seems possible that one of the readings of 5480 could be
        semantically reasonable. Likewise for 20,950. Overall I'm still getting a 
        grip on Northern Alta, it's difficult for me to parse for now as it's quite
        distinct from any other language I've seen.

4. I added basic case marking for actor-voice intransitive predicates to my test suite. Such predicates should
   take Absolutive (or focus) case arguments. To test for this, I added sentences like "me'una siya" which may
   take this construction in Northern Alta. Siya is a 3rd person singular absolutive inpersonal pronoun, and I
   tested this same construciton against other pronouns, such as "mo," which is a second person inpersonal genitive
   pronoun. I tested this phenomena across other predicates as well, for Northern Alta marks actor-voice predicates
   in multiple ways. The prefix "men" or the infix "um" may contribute this case cosntraint. I also added tense 
   to my testsuite. Northern Alta expresses tense largely with adverbs. So I added many of the pertitent adverbs
   to distinguish between present, past, and future tense events. These include "ududma" (tomorrow), "dya'yay" 
   (now, presently today), and "sep" (still).

5. Case: Northern Alta has a complicated case system. It has voice marked clauses, which always have a voiced case
   argument, and thus seems to be focus-case. The two most general voiced case categories are actor-voice and
   undergoer-voice, though there are many different sub-categories of undergoer voice (patient, locative, conveyance).
   The focus marked argument typically takes absoltuive voice. So in actor-voiced predicates the actor will be
   absolutive case, but in undergoer-voiced predicates the undergoer will be absolutive case and the actor will be
   genitive. However, Northern Alta also has predicates that are not voice-marked. In some such cases, e.g. existentials
   and some possessives, the S value is typically absolutive case. In non-existential non-voiced predicates the S argument
   is also typically marked with absolutive case.

        'of his younger sibling is searching'     

    Tense: Northern Alta does not inflect verbs to show tense, but instead relies on adverbial phrases. These adverbs should
    follow the main predicate, and are not subject to agreement. Aspect: Northern Alta uses verb afixes to inflect for 
    perfective and progressive  aspect.Verbs are inflected for voice, and depending on their voice inflection will take
    slightly different inflections to show aspect. Sometimes an afix is added, other times consonant reduplication is involved.
    Since modifying the afixes and infixes would be too difficult at this stage, I started by simply introducing some tense 
    adverbs, since the automatically generated grammar had none.

6. Though I have started to implement a case system, Northern Alta's case markings are very complicated. There are many pronoun
   categories and each also implements case variation. Moreover, Northern Alta often shows case via particles that have no
   semantic or syntactical contribution beyond marking case to saturate the predicate's case requirements. I couldn't find an 
   elegant solution for this on the Matrix, so I resorted to classifying these particles determiners so they would resolve nicely
   with the arguments that follow them. However, this solution is at best temporary, since Northern Alta allows for such particles
   to occur mutliple times in a phrase, even in adjacent positions it seems. So the particle can saturate the predicate's requirement
   for an absolutive argument while the noun phrase itself might use a further locative or genitive determiner. Beyond this issue, I
   would like to implement aspect, though Northern Alta's use of phonetically variable infixes and affixes will make this challenging.

7. The automatically created choices file misidntifies many parts of speech. It doesn't handle case at all, and so many of the
   case particles which I have treated as determiners the automatic grammar simply lists as nouns. The result is a preponderance
   of readings with coordinated noun phrases. I plan to remove change the coordination rule to prevent this, but a better model of
   case, determiners, and pronouns would help as well.
