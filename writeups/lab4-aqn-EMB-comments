EMB> Please do not put brackets in your IGT. I want to see just the strings. The brackets should be used only if you are making a particular point about constituency.

EMB> The claim that possessor NPs aren't allowed to have determiners strikes me as unusual --- and makes me wonder again if the things you are calling determiners actually are determiners. The fact taht in is glossed as 'ABS' (and like nen precedes the NP it goes with) suggests that it might be a case-marking preposition.

EMB> Your testsuite should also include exampes like this one, testing the grammar's ability to account for the imposibility (per your description) of 'in' on the possessor:

        absence of a possessive particle. #33 tests if the grammar will parse if "nen"
        is placed before instead of after the possessum. #34 tests if the grammar will
        reject a string with "nen" placed after the possessor instead of before.

EMB> "nen" should be before, no? Do you mean before rather than after the possessor?

EMB> Reading the rest of that paragraph, I think you've just switched the terms possessor and possessum.

        position. None of the arguments are inflected, and the determiner is a separate word 
        "nen." The possessor is more like a possessum modifier than a specifier, as it follows

EMB> Not a determiner.

        This strategy successfully rejects invalid strings, but it is a bit more ambiguous 
        than desired. These settings consistently two near-identical parses for each grammatical 
        sentence input. The only difference between the two parses is that one implements
        the HEAD-ADJ-INT rule and the other the HEAD-ADJ rule to parse the "possessor particle
        possessum" segment ("beli nen aparato"). The semantics are quite similar, and we're not 
        sure how to avoid this ambiguity, though it appears it might stem from a difference in
        scope.

EMB> You can fix this in tdl editing by adding [ POSSESSOR nonpossesive ] to both of these types.

my-head-adj-phrase := head-adj-int-phrase &
  [ HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD +nvr,
                                VAL [ SUBJ clist,
                                      COMPS clist ] ],
    NON-HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD +jrp & [ POSSESSOR nonpossessive ],
                                    VAL.COMPS < > ] ].

my-adj-head-phrase := adj-head-int-phrase &
  [ HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.HEAD +nvr,
    NON-HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD +jrp & [ POSSESSOR nonpossessive ],
                                    VAL.COMPS < > ] ].

EMB> The problem here isn't one of scope, but rather that the customization system is giving you two very similar rules which probably should be combined. The above fix does the trick though. For a bit more info, see:

EMB> Testing this example, the analysis of possessives looks fine, but the semantics has =mi_n_rel and _q_sg_rel, neither of which are well-formed predicates.

        Northern Alta's clausal modifiers typically appear after the S they modify,
        but they may also appear beforehand. The modifiers appear at the beginning of
        the subordinate clause and may modify time, place, or manner.

EMB> But the subordinate clause IS the modifier! So it doesn't make sense to say that "the modifiers appear at the beginning of the subordinate clause".

and often implemented implicitly

EMB> I don't know what this means.

            'father arrives while eating'

EMB> No, 'habang' is not a clausal modifier. It is a subordinator that combines with a clause to build a clausal modifier.

EMB> Also, I don't understand the lines of your IGT. In general, I expect the grammars to be targeting the morpheme segemented line, of which you seem to have two. Meanwhile, the one that the grammar actually parses is the first line. What does that represent? (I see that it also has some segmentation in it.)

Northern Alta has ten interrograitve pronouns that may introduce constituent wh-questions.

EMB> What do you mean by "introduce" here?

  adv9_name=question_adverbs_time_space
    adv9_stem1_orth=adino
    adv9_stem1_pred=_where_a_rel
    adv9_stem6_orth=nu'ano
    adv9_stem6_pred=_when_a_rel

EMB> These are giving you incorrect semantics. They should be:

  adv9_name=question_adverbs_time_space
    adv9_stem1_orth=adino
    adv9_stem1_pred=_place_n_rel
    adv9_stem6_orth=nu'ano
    adv9_stem6_pred=_time_n_rel

EMB> Because (as you can see in the MRS) the grammar combines them with a _which_q_rel and a location predication.

  adv10_name=question_adverb_manner
    adv10_stem1_orth=anon
    adv10_stem1_pred=_why_a_rel
    adv10_stem2_orth=anompan
    adv10_stem2_pred=_why_a_rel
    adv10_stem3_orth=kumusta
    adv10_stem3_pred=_how_is_a_rel
    adv10_stem4_orth=ma'in
    adv10_stem4_pred=_why_a_rel
    adv10_stem5_orth=papeno
    adv10_stem5_pred=_how_a_rel
    adv10_stem6_orth=sa'ano
    adv10_stem6_pred=_how_many_much_a_rel

EMB> These ones probably also need different PRED values.

            'and you my dear, how many children do you have?'

EMB> This is not actually an example of an embedded wh question. Where is the embedding verb?

        We implemented this feature in the customization suite's Constituent (wh-) Question
        sub-page and by adding interrogative pronouns and two types of interrogative adverbs
        --time/space tpye and manner type-- to our lexicon. We had difficulty getting our 
        grammar to work for adverbial questions with explicit subjects. The problem seems to
        stem from how LKB processes VSO word order.Accordingly many common question types
        cannot be tested. Nonetheless our grammar manages to parse adverbial questions with 
        implicit subjects and pronominal question clauses with low ambiguity.

EMB> When you report bugs like this, please include examples! I am interested both to help you out and to document the problem, but I need IGT that goes with your grammar in order to do so well.

We also have not yet implemented adjectives, which Northern Alta treats as
    stative voice-words. Several stative verbs in English are treated as stative-voiced adjectives  
    in Northern Alta, including "sleep," which we use in several test cases.

EMB> What is stative voice and what does it contrast with?

Temporal   
    adverbs take either initial or final position, and we haven't encoded that yet.

EMB> Saying that the combine with S ought to do the trick.

 Finally, our 
    testsuite uses both "personal" and "common" noun classes even though we have not yet 
    implemented this distinction in the choices file.

EMB> What is the distinction?

5.
    There was an asyndeton NP coordination rule in the auto-grammar that seems off. There were
    several mistaken lexical entries where a stem was mistakenly entered with an affix and there
    was a mistaken morphological rule that added a prefix that is actually just part of several
    stems.


EMB> It is fine to go ahead and remove these. Do you know how coordination actually works in aqn?
