1. We implemented the following phenomena in both our choices customization file and testsuite:

  i. Aspect:

      A. Perfect
          Northern Alta by default doesn't show aspect. However, there are two inflections
          that show perfect and progressive aspect, respectively. These inflections are common,
          but the descriptive grammar's examples suggest that most sentences' verbs simply don't 
          show aspect. The perfect aspect inflection is an infix, -in-, that is typically just
          "inside" the verb stem. However, -in- actually precedes some other infixes. In particular
          one active voice infix, -um-, when applied, must appear to the right, e.g. "-in-um-."

              where      <PRF>AV-run?
              'where did (you) run?'

          We modeled this aspect inflection by implementing a verb morphotactics position class. 
          "Infix-aspect" is an obligatory infix position class with two lexical rules: one changes
          nothing and simply passes the verb on to the next position class. The other lexical rule
          adds either -in- or C-in- to the input, and specifies perfective aspect in its feature
          structure.

                    verb-pc5_lrt2_lri1_inflecting=no

      B. Progressive/Imperfect

          Progressive aspect is shown by an infixed consontant reduplication, -C-. This inflection
          is less perpiscuously marked since other affixes may cause consonant reduplication 
          towards the beginning of the verb. So while perfect aspect might show "-in-um-" the 
          analogous voiced verb with progressive aspect is "C-um--C-." Our descriptive grammar 
          claims that the opening consonant reduplication is merely phonolgoical, and not morphotactic.

              'while eating, father arrives'

          We modeled this aspect by adding a morphotactic position class "progressive_infix." This
          position class is obligatory, takes the non_derived_V_words lexical type as input. We added
          this lexical type this week to contain all the verbs we could identify that can be inflected
          for aspect. This infix is actually the very first in our chain of verb affixes, since
          progressive affixes seem to occur in the innermost position. Unfortunately, since the perfective
          infix appears a bit further out, we cannot simply have a single aspect position class to handle
          both progressive and perfective affixes. The exact construction of the progressive consonant
          reduplication also depends on the particular voicing the verb will receive, thus there are more
          lexical rules and options in this position class than there are in the perfective "infix-aspect."
          If the verb receives the actor-voice "meng-" prefix, then the progressive infix is actually -CV-,
          whereas for conveyance voice progressive, the infix is "-eC-." To accomodate this variability we
          used the following lexical rules. Each of these lexical rules change the verb's aspect to imperfect.

                    verb-pc8_lrt5_lri1_orth=-'eC-

          These implementations of aspect seem to work. The morphotactics at least seems to accept verbs with
          valid affix concatenations. To that end, we testsed some examples that are not in our current test
          suite:

          -in--um-de'él in ána'
          -in--um-de'el in ana'
          -PRF--AV-grew.up ABS child
          the child grew up

          But, as per lab instructions and as shown above, some of our testsuite examples actually already
          manfisted this phenomenon.

  ii. Voice Affixes:

          Northern Alta has an extensive "voice" system whereby verb stems gain change argument structure
          and their arguments change semantic role. There are several, but we attempted to implement the
          main six: actor, patient, locative, stative, conveyance, and potentive.
          Each of these requires distinct affixes and the voices themselves are generally incompatible, 
          with the exception of potentive, which may be combined with other voices.
          
      A. Actor voice -um- and meng-
          There are two different actor voice affixes, -um- and meng-. They both inflect the verb-stem
          for actor voice, which always takes an absolutive subject and may take an optional oblique
          undergoer object. The actor voice -um- infix may be used for meterological events (though we 
          have not yet implemented these), change of state, or in predicates where the subject takes an
          "actor" role. The actor-voice "men-" prefix expresses a "durative action that lacks an inherent
          terminal point" (García Laguía, 222). This actor voice prefix likewise takes an absolutive subject
          argument and optionally an oblique or locative undergoer object. Following the descriptive grammar,
          we grouped this prefix together with the actor-voice prefix "meng-" which also express actions, take
          an absolutive subject, and an optional oblique object.

          To implement this actor voice affix, we wrote two separate position classes. Since -um- is an
          infix close to the verb stem, it is the second link of our verb morphotactic chain, after
          the progressive inflection. Unfortunately, we could not get the transitive version of -um- to
          work. We tried implementing it as part of the same position class as the intransitive lexical
          rule below, and as an independent position class. Both of these methods failed, and it's unclear
          to us why. We did manage to implement the intransitive version, as follows:

                verb-pc4_name=infix_um
                verb-pc4_obligatory=on
                verb-pc4_order=prefix
                verb-pc4_inputs=verb-pc8

                    verb-pc4_lrt3_lri1_inflecting=no

          To implement the meng- actor voice prefix, we created corresponding valence-changing lexical 
          rules in our "prefix_voice" position class. This class contains all prefixes that alter verb
          voice, including conveyance voice, potentive voice, stative voice, and causative. We restricted
          the meng- lexical rules to make sure they don't take verbs already inflected with the -um- affix
          but allow them to modify stems that have progressive or perfective infixes. The intransitive
          meng- lexical rule changes the argument structure to intransitive, and constrains the subject
          to be absolutive. The transitive meng-lexical rule changes the argument structure to intransitive
          (abs-obl), adds an object, constrains the subject to be absolutive, and constrains the 
          added-object to be oblique case.

  iii. Coordination
          
          Northern Alta has a number of coordinate conjunctions, which coordinate different
          types of linguistic units:

            Conjunction       Meaning       Coordinated Linguistic Unit
            -----------------------------------------------------------
            at                and           Unmarked phrases (UPs), DPs, Demonstratives, Clauses
            saka              and           UPs, Dems, AdvPs, Clauses
            at saka           and           DPs, Pronouns, Clauses
            kesa              than          AdvPs
            kesara            than          DPs, Pronouns, AdvPs
            o                 or            DPs, Dems, AdvPs, Clauses
            pero              but           Clauses

          Additionally, voice-marked phrases (VPs) may be coordinated asyndetonically.
          Of these conjunctions, only 'at' and 'saka' were initially implemented, with 'at'
          coordinating NPs and VPs and 'saka' coordinating VPs only.

          The following changes were made to coordination in the choices file:

            - 'saka' now coordinates NPs in addition to VPs
            - 'at saka' was added to coordinate sentences
            - 'o' was added to coordinate sentences
            - 'pero' was added to coordinate sentences
          
          Each conjunction is a word that marks units in a monosyndeton pattern and comes before the
          coordinand. Due to limitations in the customizer, 'at saka' could not be made to coordinate
          DPs or pronouns without coordinating UPs. Additionally, 'kesa' and 'kesara' could not be made
          to coordinate AdvPs.

2. The descriptive grammar resource was consulted to determine how to translate the MMT sentences
   according to vocabulary, case, and voice-marking.

   The nouns 'dog', 'cat', 'car', and 'park' were translated as 'asó', 'pósa', 'sasakyan' (vehicle),
   and 'kampo' (field) respectively. Exact equivalents for 'car' and 'park' could not be found in
   the grammar resource. Plural nouns were marked with the plural-marking affix '-sid', unless they could
   instead be marked with the plural absolutive article 'siden' or plural genitive 'niden'. For
   examples where nouns are accompanied by the definite article 'the', we use the specificity marker
   affix -i.

   The intranstive verbs 'sleep' and 'be hungry' were translated as stative voice-marked words
   'ma-póled' (ST-sleep) and 'ma-bitíl' (ST-hunger) respectively.  These stative-marked words each take
   one argument case-marked by an absolutive singular article 'in' or plural 'siden'. The intransitive verb
   'eat', however, is typically found as actor voice-marked meng-án (AV-eat) in the grammar resource, also
   taking one argument with an absolutive article.

   The transitive verb 'chase' was translated as active voice-marked 'meng-damalog' with an absolutive
   case-marked subject and oblique case-marked object for all applicable sentences except 'I chase you',
   for which it is instead translated as patient voice-marked 'damalog-en' (chase-PV) with the
   1pi.GEN+2s.ABS fused pronoun "ta'a", which is similar to the example "ebbud-en ta'a" ('I love you')
   found in the grammar resource.

   For the adnominal modifier 'in the park' we use genitive case-marker 'ni' to mark 'kampo' (field)
   as the "possessor" of the dogs and for prepositional 'in the park' or predicational 'be in the park'
   we use locative case-marker 'ta' to mark 'kampo' as the location of the activity/state of being. For
   the modifer 'hungry' we use the unmarked word 'bitélen' (hungry) with linker particle 'a'.

   For the predicational 'be' as in 'The dogs are the cats' we use predicate marker 'ay'.

   For coordination of NPs we use the conjunction 'at' and for clauses we use 'at saka'.

   For negation of predicates we use clause-initial negative existential 'awon'.

   For wh- question words we use clause-initial 'tiyaheno' (who) and 'aheno' (what).

   For yes/no questions we use the question particle 'bat' after the predicate.

   For the subordinating conjunction 'because' we use clause-initial 'dahil' (because).

   The skipped sentences are not necessarily impossible to translate but examples of complement phrases
   in the resource grammar are esoteric.

3. The first problem encountered in setting up the MT was the difference between the version of ACE
   used in the pre-compiled eng and sje grammars and the version downloaded from the ACE home page.
   This incompatibility was solved by simply recompiling the grammars the same way we would compile the
   aqn grammar. After solving this problem, we attempted to translate the first eng sentence into aqn.
   This failed due to an extraneous rule definition `ex-det := extracted-det-phrase.` which LKB ignored
   but ACE considered a fatal error. We were able to safely delete this rule and did not encounter any
   other problems thereafter.
   
   Upon translating the first eng sentence to aqn, 51375 results were produced. One such result was
   'Ma-póled asó-i-sid', which is almost correct but is missing the absolutive singular article 'in'.
   Inspecting more of the translated outputs, we observed that none actually contained this article,
   leading us to believe that the case-marking articles may be mistakenly considered optional in the
   grammar.

   Upon translating the first sje sentence to aqn, 51292 results were produced. 'Ma-póled asó-i-sid'
   was again a produced output.

4. NOTE: Initial grammar testsuite results are considerably worse than in Lab 4 as our testsuite was
   rewritten to reflect our changes to morphotactics and to be more in-line with the conventions used
   in the corpus. One such change was marking reduplication with the character 'C' and surrounding
   infixes with dashes '-', e.g. 'lumelbut' was changed to 'C-um--C-lbut'

      +-------------+----------------------+-------------------------+------------------------------+

    It appears likely that our morphotactics and coordination rule changes have increased ambiguity
    drastically only for certain examples. Two testsuite examples are responsible for nearly 74% of our
    total testsuite readings. Additionally, our total translation results for eng to aqn increased
    from roughly 26000 to roughly 51000. This will be addressed in future labs.
