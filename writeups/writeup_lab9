1. MRS Refinement

    Much of our work to refine the MRS was accomplished in previous labs,
    including implementation of the n-bar-predicate-rule and clausal
    complementizer 'a' as well as corrections to faulty implementations of
    pronouns (lacking pron_rel relations) and wh- words (lacking _thing_n_rel
    and _person_n_rel relations and lacking wh-pronoun-noun-lex lexical type).

    In this lab, we corrected a mistake in the clausal-comp-verb-lex, namely
    the correction of clausal-comp-verb-lex to constrain the subject to be a
    genitive-case NP and the complement to have a 'comp' HEAD value. This
    correction should provide better MRS for sentences with clausal complements,
    such as mmt sentences 6 and 7.

    northern_alta.tdl:

        clausal-comp-verb-lex := main-verb-lex & clausal-second-arg-trans-lex-item &
            [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS < #comps & 
                     [ LOCAL.CAT [ MC -,
                             HEAD comp ,
                             VAL [ SUBJ < >,
                             COMPS < > ] ] ] >,
              ARG-ST < [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD +np &
                       [ CASE gen ] ],
                       #comps > ].

    Additionally, we implemented the following rule to prevent embedded clauses
    from being arbitrarily switched in translation. Its effect was seen to
    correctly prevent switching of 'because' clauses such as mmt sentence 25,
    where 'dahil' and 'kasi' are subordinate clause-initial analogs of
    'because'. (Note that the order of the clauses may change due to free
    clause order, but 'dahil'/'kasi' always co-occurs with 'pósa' [cat] and
    never 'asó' [dog], as was previously seen before implementing the rule.

    northern_alta.tdl:

        qeq :+
          [ HARG.INSTLOC #il,
            LARG.INSTLOC #il ].

    Lastly, we reverted a previous change to the lexical entry for 'bitíl', wherein
    its relation _hungry_v_rel was changed to _hungry_a_rel as a translation
    workaround. We instead implemented and instantiated the following transfer
    rules to reconcile the differences in MRS.

    mmt/tm/acm.tdl:

        ;; From aqn: change _hunger_v_rel to _hungry_a_rel

        hunger-hungry-mtr := monotonic_mtr &
        [ INPUT [ RELS < [ PRED "_hunger_v_rel",
                LBL #lbl,
                ARG0 #arg0,
                ARG1 #arg1 ] >,
            HCONS < [ HARG #harg,
                        LARG #larg ] > ],
        OUTPUT [ RELS < [ PRED "_hungry_a_rel",
                    LBL #lbl,
                    ARG0 #arg0,
                    ARG1 #arg1 ] >,
            HCONS < [ HARG #harg,
                        LARG #larg ] > ]].

        ;; To aqn: change _hungry_a_rel to _hunger_v_rel

        hungry-hunger-mtr := monotonic_mtr &
        [ INPUT [ RELS < [ PRED "_hungry_a_rel",
                LBL #lbl,
                ARG0 #arg0,
                ARG1 #arg1 ] >,
            HCONS < [ HARG #harg,
                        LARG #larg ] > ],
        OUTPUT [ RELS < [ PRED "_hunger_v_rel",
                    LBL #lbl,
                    ARG0 #arg0,
                    ARG1 #arg1 ] >,
            HCONS < [ HARG #harg,
                        LARG #larg ] > ]].

    mmt/tm/aqn/acm.mtr:

        hungry-hunger := hungry-hunger-mtr.

    mmt/tm/eng/acm.mtr:

        hunger-hungry := hunger-hungry-mtr.

    Note that this change applies only to hungry as an AP predicate, i.e.
    mmt sentence 15, not as a modifer, i.e. sentence 12. To implement hungry
    as a modifier we would need to implement an additional usage of 'a' as a
    modifier clause-linking particle in addition to complement clause-linking.
    As such, mmt sentence 15 parses and translates, but not 12.

2. Overgeneration Reduction

    Two major sources of mmt overgeneration were a lack of a no-aspect type for
    unaspected predicates and a mistake in the suffix_locative_voice-lex-rule
    definition.

    The first problem caused sentences with extraneous verbal inflection for
    perfective or imperfective aspect to be generated in addition to sentences
    with unaspected verbs. The consequence of this could be seen in the
    translation of virtually every mmt sentence with a verbal predicate. In the
    case of sentence 7, it caused the mmt to run out of RAM.

    This problem was corrected by creating a no-aspect subtype of aspect and
    creating additional semi.vpm rules to facilitate proper translation of
    aspect. Although sentence 7 still fails to translate, it is no longer
    intractable, and other mmt sentences such as 2, 3, 5, 8-14, etc. no longer
    show any sign of perfective affixes such as 'C-in-' or '-in-', nor
    imperfective affixes such as 'eC-'.

    northern_alta.tdl:

        no-aspect := aspect.
    
    semi.vpm:

        E.ASPECT : ASPECT
          [...]
          no-aspect << [e]
          aspect <> *

    The second problem was caused by an accidental constraint of PATIENT-VERB-FLAG +
    rather than LOCATIVE-VERB-FLAG + in suffix_locative_voice-lex-rule. This caused
    verbs which take patient voice-marking suffix '-en' (such as 'damólag') to also
    take locative voice-marking suffix '-an', creating extraneous mmt translations
    containing the incorrectly-inflected word 'damólag-an' in addition to those
    containing the correctly-inflected word 'damólag-en'.

    This was corrected by simply replacing 'PATIENT-VERB-FLAG' with 'LOCATIVE-VERB-FLAG'
    in the relevant lexical rule definition.

    northern_alta.tdl:

        suffix_locative_voice-lex-rule := infl-lex-rule & suffix-lex-rule-super &
          [ DTR.INFLECTED [ LOCATIVE-VERB-FLAG + ],

    The effects of this correction may be seen in any mmt sentence containing the
    morpheme 'damólag', such as 2, 3, 5, 6, 8-11, 27, none of which produces any
    translation with the incorrect 'damólag-an' when translated into aqn.


3. Residual Realization Ambiguity

    A minor source of overgeneration is the switching of order of 'because'
    clauses, which, as previously discussed, is not incorrect behavior and is
    also fairly negligible.

    One of the remaining apparent sources of overgeneration is redundant lexical
    entries for enclitic pronouns, such as 1s.GEN "'o", 2s.GEN "m"/"mo",
    2p.ABS "am"/"amyu"/"am'yu", etc. These lexical entries were included to
    increase coverage of the corpus, which uses many of these variants
    inconsistently. Examples of such lexical entries are shown below:

    lexicon.tdl:

        _27o := gen_1s-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "'o" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

        _3D_27o := gen_1s-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "='o" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

        mo := gen_2s-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "mo" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

        m := gen_2s-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "m" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

        _3Dm := gen_2s-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "=m" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

        _3Dmo := gen_2s-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "=mo" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

        am := abs_2p-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "am" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

        _3Dam := abs_2p-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "=am" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

        amyu := abs_2p-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "amyu" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

        am_27yu := abs_2p-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "am'yu" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

        _3Damyu := abs_2p-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "=amyu" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

        _3Dam_27yu := abs_2p-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "=am'yu" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

        _3Damyú := abs_2p-noun-lex &
        [ STEM < "=amyú" >,
            SYNSEM.LKEYS.KEYREL.PRED "pron_rel" ].

    While the ambiguity of these redundant lexical entries is likely responsible
    for much overgeneration, we would not consider any of the overgenerated
    sentences to be necessarily incorrect.

    Another apparent source of overgeneration is the apparent ambiguity of
    common nouns between singular and plural, which is unlikely to be resolved
    as this ambiguous behavior is supported by some examples in the resource
    grammar. This alone does not necessarily cause overgeneration, however, the
    enclitic '=sid' is used to explicitly mark common nouns as plural, which
    results in translations which may either include or omit this morpheme,
    effectively doubling the number of generated sentences for each common noun.

    The last apparent source of ambiguity is the specificity marker '-i', which
    we liken to usage of 'the' as a definite article in English. However, its
    usage seems to be sometimes optional or context-dependent in many examples
    in the resource grammar. Thus, its behavior is unspecified in the MRS and so
    its inclusion in translations is entirely optional, resulting in translations
    that may either include or omit it, again effectively doubling the number
    of generated sentences for each common noun.

    Here is an IGT example from the grammar resource of a sentence containing a
    plural noun which is apparently understood to undergo existential
    quantification, and in which neither '-i' nor '=sid' is used (note that 'in'
    is a SINGULAR absolutive case-marking article):

        meng-alaw in  duwa a  aso
        AV-play   ABS two  LK dog
        'the two dogs are playing'

    These 3 sources of ambiguity compound to produce, in some cases, many
    thousands of overgenerated sentences (e.g. mmt sentences 6 and 9), but we
    would not necessarily discount all of these sentences as incorrect.
