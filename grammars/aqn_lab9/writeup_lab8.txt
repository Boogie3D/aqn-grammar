1. Updated Non-verbal Predicate NP rule
        We attempted to get a non-verbal NP predicate rule to work for Northern
    Alta. This project is a hold-over from lab 7, wherein our implementation
    of the n-bar-predicate-rule resulted in a runaway rule error when loaded in
    lkb and stalled while parsing the Northern Alta corpus. Rectifying this
    n-bar-predicate-rule took several steps outlined below and based on our
    attempt to parse the corpus item:

        álap-en =mo obra =séla a ulámen in pusó =na ni'nén a ságing
        alap-әn       =mo       obra  =séla   a     ulamen  =na       a   ságing
        get-something =2s.GEN   can   =also   LK    lunch   =already  LK  banana
        you can also get a banana for lunch 

    But since this item contains some tricky vocabulary that and phenomena 
    beyond the current rule, it is more convenient to reference the following example
    instead for clarification.

        pusa=i=sid  asu=i=sid
        cat=SPEC=PL dog=SPEC=PL
        'The dogs are the cats'
    
    We noticed the lkb parse trees for failed readings of the longer example above
    included a suprising number of VP-B and VP-T phrases, which result from
    the application of vp1-bottom-cord and the vp2-top-cord rules respectively.
    
        The initial step we took to resolve this runaway rule error was to modify the
    n-bar-predicate-rule such that it will not apply to pronouns. This meant editing 
    the northern_alta.tdl by adding a [PRON -] constraint on the HEAD value of the phrases
    first daughter:

            n-bar-predicate-rule := unary-phrase & nocoord &
        [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT [ HEAD verb & [ MOD < >],
                                VAL [ COMPS < >, SPR < >, SPEC < >,
                                    SUBJ < [ LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX #arg1,
                                                        CAT [ HEAD noun,
                                                        VAL.SPR < > ] ] ] > ] ],
                    NON-LOCAL #nl ],
            C-CONT [ HOOK [ LTOP #ltop,
                            INDEX #index,
                                    XARG #arg1 ],
                    RELS.LIST < arg12-ev-relation &
                                [ PRED "_be_v_id_rel",
                                    LBL #ltop,
                                    ARG0 #index,
                                    ARG1 #arg1,
                                    ARG2 #arg2 ] >,
                    HCONS.LIST <  > ],
                    ARGS < [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL [ CAT [ HEAD noun & [ PRON - ],
                                                    VAL.SPR < > ],
                                            CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #arg2
                                                        ] ],
                                    NON-LOCAL #nl ] ] > ].

        Next we noticed the ex-adj rule was adding to undesirable parses, so
    we commented that rule out from our rules.tdl file as follows:

        ;ex-adj := basic-extracted-adj-phrase.

        Finally, we noticed that the particular item that stalled our grammar's
    attempt to process the corpus contained the token "a," and that this token was
    analyzed as a noun. However, "a" is a linker particle, cannot be parsed as a noun,
    and thus cannot serve as input to the n-bar-predicate rule, as it was. Consequently
    we removed this item from our lexicon. These three alterations resolved our 
    runaway rule error.
